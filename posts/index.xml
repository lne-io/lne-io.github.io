      <description>Iâ€™ve got a new computer recently and the first thing I did was creating a new partition and install my favorite operating system which is Linux (Ubuntu). As a developer I always like to separate working environments as much as possible. For this reason I create virtual machines to setup my projects.
VirtualBox shared folders feature allows me to write code on the host machine and gets it synchronized with guest machine instantly.</description>
